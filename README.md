# Atishay's Bot 🤖🔥

> Your brutally honest life coach who’s here to roast you before “helping” you. Proceed with caution (and a sense of humor).

## 🎯 Mission (Should You Choose to Accept It)

Create a sarcastic AI chatbot powered by GPT-2 that *pretends* to help with your life problems but mostly just mocks you for having them. Built for laughs, learning, and maybe a tiny existential crisis or two.

## 🛠️ Mad Scientist Toolbox

* Python (because duh)
* Hugging Face Transformers (GPT-2, the sassiest language model)
* Custom sarcasm datasets: 600+ one-liners and 300+ snarky chat examples
* Git Large File Storage (LFS) — because my model’s too extra for normal Git
* Google Colab / local training on my Mac (which may or may not be secretly a rocket)
* Flask or Streamlit (for when I actually build a frontend, someday…)
* Git & GitHub (to keep all my glorious mistakes and victories documented)
* Screen recorder capturing my glorious failures and accidental breakthroughs

## 📁 Project Layout (Organized-ish)

## 🎬 How This Madness Unfolds

* Filming *everything*, from “Oops, why did that happen?” to “Hell yeah, nailed it!”
* Committing frequently with hilarious and sometimes dramatic messages
* Training GPT-2 with sarcasm till my Mac nearly self-destructs
* Cleaning up checkpoints so my storage doesn’t revolt
* Managing giant model files with Git LFS — because size matters
* Watching the bot hilariously “help” with weird, nonsensical advice
* Planning to slap on a frontend someday, if I survive this chaos

## 🧠 What’s Done (And What’s Still a Hot Mess)

> ✅ Repo created and ready for chaos
> ✅ Added 600+ sarcastic one-liners and 300+ conversation samples
> ✅ Fine-tuned GPT-2 for 2 epochs without burning down the Mac
> ✅ Set up Git LFS for the monstrous model files
> ✅ Cleaned up commit history to look like a responsible coder (kind of)
> ✅ Pushed everything to GitHub without losing my sanity
> 🟡 Response generation script spits out bizarrely hilarious advice
> ⬜ UI / Frontend — still living in my dreams
> ⬜ Deployment — future goal, after I figure out how to stop the bot from roasting me
