# Atishay's Bot 🤖🧠

> The only life coach you'll ever need... if you're okay being roasted first.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a sarcastic, funny AI-powered chatbot using GPT-2. It pretends to help you with your problems, but mostly makes fun of you for having them. Built just for fun, to learn how to fine-tune AI models and make people laugh (or cry a little).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers (GPT-2)
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks
- Flask (for backend, optional)
- HTML/CSS or Streamlit (for UI)
- Git & GitHub (tracking everything)
- Screen recorder (filming the whole process)
